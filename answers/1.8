Since we only have one branch we don't need to do this but to quickly check if we are in the main use this command:
git checkout main

let's create the new branch: 
git branch feature/adumbledore

we can go the new branch we created:
git checkout feature/adumbledore

quickly rename it with my name:
git branch -m feature/vcotella
