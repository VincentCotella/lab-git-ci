First we edit the identity.md file with our personal info: for me Vincent Cotella.

then we use the following commands:

1. git add identity.md

2. git commit -m "Updated personal information"

3. git push 
(when we do git push it will open a page to sign up on our github account and then we can check if "identity.md" got updated which it did)
